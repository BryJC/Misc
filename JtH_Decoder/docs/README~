README

Not sure what to put here exactly, I've never written one before! Anyway, I used a combo of some python and a few html files so the text could be decoded in the browser and not on the command line.

THAT said:

The program DOES need to be booted from the command line (also not sure if this would work in Windows, I guess so? These instructions are for linux):

    1) go to: ~$/Projects/
    2) run: python bin/app.py
    3) go to browser: localhost:8080/decoder
    4) Enter your text!
    
Let me know if this makes sense! Thanks for the challenge!
